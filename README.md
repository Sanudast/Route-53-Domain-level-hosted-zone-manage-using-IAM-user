# Route-53-Domain-level-hosted-zone-manage-using-IAM-user

## Description

In this article I will help you to manage the Amazon Route 53 domain hosted zone using IAM user. 
Amazon Route 53 is a highly available and scalable cloud Domain Name System (DNS) web service. It is designed to give developers and businesses an extremely reliable and cost effective way to route end users to Internet applications by translating names like www.example.com into the numeric IP addresses like 192.0.2.1 that computers use to connect to each other. Amazon Route 53 is fully compliant with IPv6 as well.

A hosted zone is an Amazon Rote 53 concept. A hosted zone is analogous to a traditional DNS zone file; it represents a collection of records that can be managed together, belonging to a single parent domain name. All resource record sets within a hosted zone must have the hosted zone's domain name as a suffix.

## Prerequisite

AWS account with management console access and full access to Route 53 and IAM services.
